### About this documentation
This documentation gives an overview of those files included in this repository that are needed to replicate the results of "Kranz, S. and Pütz. P.: Methods Matter: p-Hacking and Publication Bias in Causal Analysis in Economics: Comment", aimed for publication in the AER.
The analyses were conducted using R 4.0.5 (64 bit, Windows). All R and Stata scripts are stored in the folder "Scripts", provided and created datasets are located in the folder "Data", manually created latex templates are stored in the folder "Tex_templates" and results obtained by running the scripts are stored in the folder "Results". All datasets and results that either need a long time or Stata to be generated are already provided in the respective folders.

### Manual to replicate the results
If you use RStudio, open the R project 
`mm_replication.Rproj` first, then all R scripts loaded into this project should run as they are. Adjustments of the paths should be only necessary for the do-file (see 6.)
If you do not use an R project, you have to set your working directory at the beginning of each R script (`setwd(…)`) to the directory where the scripts are located.

0. Install the required packages by using "install_packages.R". Note that the package [RoundingMatters](https://github.com/skranz/RoundingMatters) was written mainly for this replication.

1. Run the function "adapt.MM.data" in "make_new_data.R"" to create the adapted version of BCH's data set:
`source("Scripts/make_new_data.R")`
`adapt.MM.data()`

2. Run dsr_job.R to create immediate files for dsr derounding.
`source("Scripts/dsr_job.R")`

3. Source "deround_bch.R" and run the function "study.windows.with.bch.data" to create data for randomization tests.
`source("Scripts/deround_bch.R")`
`study.windows.with.bch.data()`

4. After you have run those functions you can run/knit the RMD files to generate most of the figures and tables. The binomial tests are created by "binom_tables.Rmd".

5. "mc.R" contains code for the Monte-Carlo simulation. Takes very long to run.
`source("Scripts/mc.R")`
`run.mc()`

6. There are no R files for the caliper tests. We used the stata code provided by BCH with slight amendments ("caliper_tables.do"). Adjust working directories whenever the command "cd" is used.

7. For generating the results for the Andrews and Kasy method the files "IV.csv", "DID.csv", "RCT.csv" and "RDD.csv" in the Data folder have to be plugged Max Kasy's App on https://maxkasy.github.io/home/metastudy/. The csv-files are created by "andrews_kasy_create_data.do".

8. BCH's Figure 1-6 after applying the omission approach can be generated by "BCH_figures_replicated.do".

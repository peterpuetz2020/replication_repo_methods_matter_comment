\begin_layout Abstract
Brodeur et al.
 (2020) study hypothesis tests from economic articles and find evidence
 for p-hacking and publication bias, in particular for IV and DID studies.
 We adjust for rounding errors in reported estimates and standard errors
 using different approaches.
 Statistical evidence for p-hacking from randomization tests and caliper
 tests at the 5% significance threshold robustly vanishes for DID studies
 but remains for IV studies.
 In addition, BCH derive latent distribution of z-statistics absent publication
 bias using two different approaches.
 We show that neither approach is applicable due to reasons unrelated to
 rounding.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Brodeur et al.
 (2020) study a large number of hypothesis tests from economic articles
 and find evidence for p-hacking or publication bias, in particular for
 studies using an IV or DID approach.
 We show that a crucial continuity assumption is violated because many collected
 estimates and standard errors are reported with just a single significant
 digit.
 These rounding errors cause bunching of computed z-statistics, particularly
 at exactly 2.
 We propose and compare different adjustments.
 Under every adjustment evidence for p-hacking from randomization and caliper
 tests at the 5% significance threshold substantially reduces.
 We find no more significant results for DID studies, but effects remain
 similar and significant for IV studies.
 Brodeur et al.
 (2020) perform additional tests that seem less affected by rounding errors.
 Yet, we highlight several problems of these tests.

\begin_layout Standard
Abel Brodeur, Nikolai Cook, and Anthony Heyes (2020), henceforth BCH, have
 collected a huge, very insightful data set of hypothesis tests from 25
 economic journals.
 They compare articles that employ different empirical strategies to estimate
 causal effects and find evidence for p-hacking or publication bias overall
 and in particular for results relying on instrumental variables (IV) and
 to a smaller extent for difference-in-differences estimates (DID).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper first shows in Section 1 that a crucial continuity assumption
 of the underlying z-statistic is violated in the collected data set because
 of rounding errors in the reported coefficients and standard errors that
 cause bunching of computed z-statistics.
 Particularly problematic is that many reported z-statistics bunch at exactly
 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

.
 In Section 2, we compare and partly newly develop different approaches
 to adjust for rounding errors.
 All yield similar results on BCH's data set as Section 3 shows: Evidence
 for p-hacking in the data set substantially weakens.
 Replicating BCH's randomization and caliper tests at the 5% significance
 threshold, evidence remains for IV but not for DID and the other methods.
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We compare different adjustment procedures.
 Our first proposal is to simply drop observations for which standard errors
 are reported with a low significand.
 We use a Monte-Carlo study to compare that approach with alternative derounding
 procedures.
 Brodeur et.
 al.
 (2016) and Bruns et al.
 (2019) use derounding procedures that assume that unobserved digits of
 the reported coefficient and standard errors are uniformly distributed.
 Our simulations show that the 95% confidence intervals of such uniform
 derounding procedures can have a coverage probability above 95% if the
 null hypothesis of no p-hacking and locally uniformly distributed z-statistics
 is satisfied.
 Yet, the procedures can induce an attenuation bias if the null hypothesis
 is violated.
 We also propose two modified derounding procedures that adjust the derounding
 draws by estimating the density of z-statistics from observations with
 sufficiently many significant digits.
 Similar to just omitting observations that are too coarsely rounded these
 procedures counter the attenuation bias.
 While the different approaches that adjust for rounding errors have different
 strengths and weaknesses, they all yield very similar results on BCH's
 data set.
 In contrast, results substantially differ if the rounding problem is not
 addressed.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Section 4, we note issues unrelated to rounding.
 In their analysis of excess test statistics, BCH use two different approaches
 to recover the latent distribution of z-statistics absent publication bias
 and p-hacking.
 The first approach uses a calibration that relies on the assumption that
 p-hacking and publication bias don't affect the probability mass in the
 tails of observed z-statistics (for 
\begin_inset Formula $z\ge5$
\end_inset

).
 Yet, we prove that this approach generally fails to recover the true latent
 distribution.
 Even if publication bias only reduces publication probabilities for small
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, it will affect the probability mass in the tails, as the total probability
 mass has to integrate to one.
 We also note that the supposed latent distributions cannot explain an excess
 share of observed z-statistics close to zero.
 The second approach to recover a latent distribution is based on Andrews
 and Kasy (2019).
 It requires that in the latent distribution coefficients and standard errors
 are independently distributed from each other.
 We test this assumption and show that it is strongly violated in BCH's
 data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A feature of BHC's analysis that robustly remains is that the density of
 z-statistics shows a hump loosely around 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

.
 In our concluding remarks, we discuss a possible alternative source for
 this hump and the implications for randomization tests also at the 10%
 and 1% significance thresholds.
 Finally, we directly compare the distribution of z-statistics of the different
 subsamples to that of randomized controlled trials (RCT).
 The results suggest that insignificant results for DID, IV and to smaller
 extent for regression discontinuity designs (RDD) face a relatively tougher
 publication hurdle than for RCT.

The rounding problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BCH have collected data for more than 21,000 hypothesis tests.
 For most tests (90.2%) the reported coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and its standard error 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 are collected and the (absolute) z-statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $z=abs(\mu)/\sigma$
\end_inset

 is computed from these values.
 For the remaining tests, the z-statistic is derived from a reported t-statistic
 (5.0%), p-value (4.7%) or CI (0.1%).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One of our initial comments also detected that BCH's conversion from p-values
 into z-statistics wrongly assumed that all p-values correspond to one-sided
 tests.
 Brodeur et al.
 corrected this problem and also detected some smaller typos when converting
 the raw data.
 They kindly provided us with a corrected version of the data set and also
 made it publicly available.
 We use that updated data set for all our analyses in this comment.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BCH's main statistical analyses focus on the 5% significance threshold.
 For their randomization tests, they assume that absent p-hacking or publication
 bias, the distribution of z-statistics would be continuous and differentiable
 so that in a sufficiently small window 
\begin_inset Formula $[1.96-h,1.96+h]$
\end_inset

 around the 5% significance threshold, there should be roughly equally many
 significant results with 
\begin_inset Formula $z\ge1.96$
\end_inset

 as insignificant results with 
\begin_inset Formula $z<1.96$
\end_inset

.

Ideally, one would use observation-specific thresholds that refer to the
 t distribution and take into account the degrees of freedom instead of
 using the normal approximation.
 Pütz and Bruns (2020) show that low degrees of freedom are regularly encountere
d in top economics.
 One important reason is the frequent use of clustered standard errors and
 thus the number of clusters as base for the degrees of freedom.
 In particular due to clustered standard errors, it is often not possible
 to collect the correct degrees of freedom from the information given in
 regression tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BCH compare the shares of significant and insignificant tests for a grid
 of window half-widths 
\begin_inset Formula $h\in\{0.05,0.075,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5\}$
\end_inset

.
 For the smallest considered window significantly and substantially more
 significant z-statistics can be found for all subsamples differentiated
 by strategy for estimating causal effects.
 For the largest windows significantly more z-statistics above 1.96 are observed
 only for DID and IV.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The left panel of Figure 1 shows the corresponding shares of z-statistics

For window half-widths below 0.04, less than 50% of z-statistics are above
 the threshold of 1.96.
 But there is a massive, discontinuous increase of significant z-statistics
 once the window half-width exceeds 0.04.
 This jump has not been discussed by BCH whose smallest considered window
 half-width of 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0.05$
\end_inset

 is already on the right

hand side of this discontinuity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discontinuity occurs because the data set contains 260 z-statistics
 with a value of exactly 2.
 All these observations are counted as significant and thus cause the jump
 in the share of significant tests once 
\begin_inset Formula $1.96+h$
\end_inset

 reaches 2.
 These 260 observations constitute 37.9% of the total observations in the
 smallest window analyzed by BCH.
 The left panel of Figure 2 shows the number of observations included for
 each window half-width and verifies the substantial jump at 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0.04$

 The right panels of Figure 1 and Figure 2 present adjusted results and

If the estimates and standard errors had been reported with more significant
 digits, the computed z-statistic could well have been smaller than 1.96.
 For example, assume the reported standard error is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0.02$
\end_inset

.
 Then this observation has a computed z-statistic of exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

 if the reported estimate is also rounded to one significant digit and given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0.04$
\end_inset

.
 If one computed the z-statistic with the original non-rounded values, it
 may range from an insignificant lower bound of 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1.4$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $0.035/0.025$

\begin_layout Section
Approaches to adjust for the rounding problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Omitting observations that are too coarsely rounded
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first approach for adjusting for rounding errors is derived from a simple
 idea: just omit all observations that were reported with too few significant
 digits.
 For a conservative approach, we would recommend to keep only observations
 which report estimates and standard errors with at least three significant
 digits.
 However, omitting observations reduces power and thus makes it harder to
 find evidence for p-hacking.
 In our reanalysis of BCH's results, we will follow a less conservative
 approach and omit all observations whose standard error has a significand
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 below 37.
 The significand consists of the significant digit(s) written as an integer,
 e.g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0.012$
\end_inset

 the significand is 
\begin_inset Formula $s=12$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Brodeur et al.
 kindly added to the updated data set new columns where coefficients and
 standard errors are given as strings that also indicate trailing zeros.
 We only omit (or perform derounding) among the roughly 90% of observations
 whose reported z-statistic is computed from reported 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In the following, we motivate and illustrate this criterion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Crucial assumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A crucial assumption is that the omission criterion is not systematically
 related to the unobserved distribution of true z-statistics absent rounding
 errors.
 E.g.
 if coarse rounding was more (less) likely if the unobserved true 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is above the significance threshold, the adjustment could induce a selection
 bias causing a systematical under-estimation (over-estimation) of the share
 of significant test statistics in the randomization tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assumption cannot be directly tested as the unrounded, true z-statistics
 are unobserved.
 However, it suggests that for the reported z-statistics the distribution
 of the selected sample should look similar to that of the full sample,
 except for the bunching points.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:excess-tests"

\end_inset

 (further below) shows that indeed the kernel density estimates of the two
 samples look very similar.
 In a similar spirit, the assumption suggests that reported z-statistics
 and reported standard errors should not exhibit a strong correlation: indeed
 we find a correlation of only 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.0002$
\end_inset

 with 95% confidence interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[-0.0138,0.0134]$
\end_inset

.
 Also the empirical correlation between a dummy indicating that an observation
 is omitted and the reported z-statistic is only 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.005$
\end_inset

 with 95% confidence interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[-0.019,0.008]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One concern could be that coarse rounding might go hand in hand with p-hacking
 in order to report higher z-statistics.
 This would suggest that we observe more coarse rounding for z-statistics
 that are close to the 5% threshold where p-hacking concerns may be most
 relevant.
 However, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:excess-tests"

\end_inset

 shows that in that range the selected subsample without coarse rounding
 even has a slightly larger density than the complete sample.
 Also recall Footnote 3, which shows that almost half of a selection of
 DID tests with 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

 indeed reported significance level above 5%, i.e.
 for these tests coarse rounding was not used to wrongfully suggest a 5%
 significance level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The omission threshold
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On average, a smaller significand 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a more severe rounding problem for the reported z-statistic.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:count_omit"

\end_inset

 shows that our adjustment that omits all observations with 
\begin_inset Formula $s<37$
\end_inset

 omits 37.9% of all observations, but 87.3% of observations with 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

 and roughly 81.1% of other observations that have a z-statistic on which
 at least 10 observations were bunched on.

Correspondingly, the right-hand panel of Figure 2 shows that with our sample
 selection, the number of included observations increases smoothly with

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To motivate why we picked the significand 
\begin_inset Formula $s=37$
\end_inset

 as omission threshold, we continue with
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
Consider an observation where the reported coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and standard error 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 are rounded to the same decimal place.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $z=\mu/\sigma$
\end_inset

 be the reported z-statistic and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}$
\end_inset

 be the unobserved true z-statistic corresponding to the non-rounded values.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are guaranteed not to lie on opposite sides of an arbitrary threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 if the significand 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 satisfies
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
s\geq\frac{1+\tau}{2\vert z-\tau\vert}.\label{eq:s_thresh}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The smallest and largest possible values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}$
\end_inset

 are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tilde{z}_{min}=\frac{zs-0.5}{s+0.5}\text{ and }\tilde{z}_{max}=\frac{zs+0.5}{s-0.5}.
\]

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq\tau$
\end_inset

, we need 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}_{\min}\geq\tau$
\end_inset

 to guarantee 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}\geq\tau$
\end_inset

, which can be rearranged to (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:s_thresh"

\end_inset

).
 In a similar spirit if 
\begin_inset Formula $z\leq\tau$
\end_inset

 the relevant condition is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}_{max}\leq\tau$
\end_inset

, which also can be rearranged to (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:s_thresh"

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
We say an observation is 
\shape italic
misclassified 
\shape default
if its reported z-statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and true z-statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}$
\end_inset

 lie on opposite sides of the significance threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=1.96.$
\end_inset

 Lemma 1 implies that the smallest omission threshold guaranteeing that
 no observation with 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

 is misclassified is 
\begin_inset Formula $s=37$
\end_inset

.
 In total, there are 160 distinct z-statistics with at least 10 observations,
 but among them 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

 is closest to the significance threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=1.96$
\end_inset

.
 Note from Lemma 1 that the minimally required significand decreases in
 the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z-\tau\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, our omission threshold of 
\begin_inset Formula $s=37$
\end_inset

 implies for all of these 160 bunching values of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 that no remaining observation is misclassified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides misclassification, rounding errors can also cause an observation
 to be wrongly included in a window 
\begin_inset Formula $[1.96-h,1.96+h]$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is inside the window but 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}$
\end_inset

 outside, or wrongly excluded the other way round.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that collecting data (if available) on the reported significance levels
 for each observation could be another way to solve the misclassification
 problem arising from rounding errors.
 But it would not solve the problems of potentially wrong inclusion or exclusion.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Lemma 1 implies that an omission threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $s=37$
\end_inset

 guarantees that no remaining observation with 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

 is wrongly included or excluded from windows with half-width 
\begin_inset Formula $h\geq0.08$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, only for the two smallest window half-widths considered by BCH, we
 cannot rule out that after our adjustment some observations with 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

 are still wrongly included in that window.
 Of course, our adjustment cannot guarantee a zero risk of misclassification,
 wrong inclusion or exclusion of observations for all reported values of
 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 illustrates the risks for a window with half-width 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0.1$
\end_inset

.
 It shows, as function of the omission threshold for the significand 
\begin_inset Formula $s,$
\end_inset

 the share of observations relative to the total observations in the window
 which are at risk of being misclassified or wrongly included, as well as
 the relative number of observations outside the window at risk of being
 wrongly excluded.
 Importantly, for very low omission thresholds, we have an asymmetry: More
 observations with reported 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq1.96$
\end_inset

 are at risk of being misclassified or wrongly included, which is driven
 to a large extent by the observations with 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, more observations with 
\begin_inset Formula $z<1.96$
\end_inset

 are at risk to be wrongly excluded.
 While there is still error potential for our threshold of 
\begin_inset Formula $s=37$
\end_inset

 (gray vertical line), there are similarly many observations at risk on
 both sides of the 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1.96$

 threshold.

In the right-hand side of Figure 1, we have applied our adjustment procedure
 to the pooled data.
 The discontinuity at

 vanishes and no clear evidence for p-hacking or publication bias remains.
 The shares of significant z-statistics decrease for all window half-widths,
 they are mostly close to 50% and the confidence intervals always include
 the 50% level.

Comparison with derounding methods and Monte-Carlo study
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While BCH do not adjust for rounding errors, Brodeur et.
 al.
 (2016) and Bruns et al.
 (2019) address the problem in similar studies with derounding procedures.
 Brodeur et.
 al (2016) assume that the unobserved digits of the reported coefficient
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and standard error 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 are drawn from a uniform distribution and use such random draws to generate
 a single derounded data set.
 Bruns et al.
 (2019) reduce noise of this procedure by repeating this derounding procedure
 several times and report mean estimates.
 We adapt that method as follows: We draw 100 derounding samples and take
 the median of the estimated significance share and construct confidence
 intervals by taking the median of the lower and upper bounds of the 100
 confidence intervals.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This construction is akin to a procedure proposed by of Chernozhukov et
 al.
 (2020).
 For a different application they can establish that the resulting median
 of the 95% CI bounds has a coverage of at least 90% taking into account
 the resampling noise.
 Taking into account the promising results of the Monte-Carlo simulations
 for the case that the null hypothesis is satisfied, we do not adapt the
 confidence intervals, however.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compare the different approaches, we perform a Monte-Carlo study with
 three scenarios.
 In the first scenario, the simulated true 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are uniformly distributed on the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,2\cdot1.96]$
\end_inset

.
 In the second scenario, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is simulated such that 35% of the observations are uniformly distributed
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1.96]$
\end_inset

 and the 65% uniformly on 
\begin_inset Formula $[1.96,2\cdot1,96]$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 in each window around 
\begin_inset Formula $1.96,$
\end_inset

 we would expect 65% of the tests to be significant.
 The 3rd scenario just swaps these probabilities so that we would expect
 a 35% of the tests to be significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except for the distribution of z-statistics, we follow in all scenarios
 closely the characteristics of BCH's pooled data set in the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,2\cdot1.96]$
\end_inset

, e.g.
 each simulated sample has the same number of observations (16,777).
 Each simulated observation 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is linked to a randomly drawn (with replacement) observation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 from BCH's data.
 The simulated true standard error 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is set to a uniformly derounded version of the standard error 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 of BCH's observation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 We then compute the simulated true coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}_{j}=\tilde{z}_{j}\tilde{\sigma}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 We denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}$
\end_inset

 the simulated reported coefficients and standard errors, created by rounding
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}_{j}$
\end_inset

 to the same number of decimal places as observation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in BCH's data.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}=\mu_{j}/\sigma_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the simulated reported z-statistic.
 For each simulated sample, we compare different approaches to deal with
 the rounding problem.
 We repeat the procedure to get 100,000 simulated samples and show the averaged
 results for the first two scenarios and a window with half-width 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0.2$

\begin_layout Standard
Not adjusting for rounding causes a substantial upward bias in all three
 scenarios and the simulated coverage probabilities of the 95% confidence
 intervals are only 10.2%, 38.8% and 0.6%, respectively.
 In contrast, all adjustment approaches work well in the first scenario
 where the null hypothesis of an equal share of significant and non-significant
 tests is satisfied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the 95% confidence intervals of the median uniform derounding
 approach even achieves an excessive coverage probability of 97.1%.
 For an intuition of this excess coverage, we have also run a simulation
 where we use the original z-statistics

 and

 samples.
 The 95% confidence intervals from this procedure also have excess coverage
 in the first scenario.
 Since the noise is drawn from a uniform distribution just as the original
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}_{j}$
\end_inset

, it corrects for imbalances in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}_{j}$
\end_inset

 that arise due to sampling variation.
 While the noise itself also has random imbalances, that randomness is damped
 by taking the median over several samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our uniform derounding approach that takes medians over several derounding
 samples seems to have a similar effect.
 In contrast, there is no clear excess coverage when taking a single derounding
 sample as in Brodeur et al.
 (2016).
 Also in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE) the median derounding
 procedure is slightly superior to the other two adjustment procedures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The flip side of both uniform derounding approaches is that they induce
 an attenuation bias if the null hypothesis of locally uniform distributed
 z-statistics is not satisfied.
 Consider the 2nd scenario in which we have a 65% probability that a 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{z}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is above 1.96.
 There the 95% confidence intervals of both derounding approaches have low
 coverage (66.8% and 69.0%) and are biased towards finding a 50% share of
 significant z-statistics.
 We find similar results for the 3rd scenario.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach to omit observations whose reported standard error has a significan
d below 37 seems not to suffer from relevant systematic biases in the simulation
 study and its confidence intervals achieve approximately 95% coverage in
 all three scenarios.
 Thus if the goal is to get unbiased estimators, the omission approach seems
 preferable.
 On the other hand, the median uniform derounding approach has confidence
 intervals with higher coverage and a slightly lower RMSE if the null hypothesis
 is satisfied.
 That derounding approach may thus be preferable for conservative tests
 of the null hypothesis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
z-density adjusted derounding (ZDA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of the uniform derounding approaches in the 2nd and 3rd scenario
 is that they do not account for the fact that the original z-statistics
 are less likely to come from the region where the z statistics have lower
 density.
 We propose two derounding approaches that take this issue into account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The three bottom rows of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:mc"

\end_inset

 refer to an approach that we call z-density adjusted (ZDA) derounding.
 It modifies the derounding procedure by adjusting the derounding draws
 for the (estimated) true density of the z-statistics.
 In the first row, we use the true density 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

, which shall be normalized such that its maximum is 1.
 An adjusted derounding draw for observation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is chosen as follows.
 We first draw a uniformly derounded value 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}_{i}$
\end_inset

 as before but randomly reject that draw with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $1-f(\hat{z}_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 If we reject a draw, we repeat the procedure until a drawn derounded value
 is accepted.
 This well known rejection sampling technique causes the adjusted derounded
 values 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}_{i}$
\end_inset

 to be drawn from a distribution whose density is proportional to the product
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 and the density implied by the uniform derounding approach.
 Except for this adjustment, we proceed as in the described median uniform
 derounding approach.
 In the first scenario the adjustment has no effect since the z-statistics
 are uniformly distributed and thus no draw will be rejected.
 Yet, in the 2nd scenario the adjustment achieves again excess coverage
 of 97.1% and an estimated bias close to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results shall only illustrate that the method would work under ideal
 conditions.
 Yet, outside Monte-Carlo simulations the true density 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 is obviously unknown.
 The final two rows consider a feasible variant of the procedure by replacing
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)$
\end_inset

 with a kernel estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f}(z)$
\end_inset

 of the normalized density.
 We estimate that density using the subsample of z-statistics whose standard
 error is reported with at least three significant digits.
 We only perform the z-density adjusted derounding for observations whose
 standard error has less than three significant digits and otherwise perform
 uniform derounding.
 That is because sampling errors when estimating 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f}(z)$
\end_inset

 may become more severe if the derounded values can only fall into a small
 window around 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
PP: Is it reasonable to look at the number of significand digits for the
 standard errors or shouldn't one rather look at width of the derounding
 bounds? e.g.
 only use z-density adjusted derounding if width of derounding bounds (=upper-lo
wer derounding bound) is larger than the bandwidth or includes more than
 10 observations...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SK: I guess that is true, but more complex.
 There are many possible criteria.
 Ideally, one could use the simulation for hyper-parameter tuning...
 but I don't know whether that is worth the effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
PP: I agree.
 Let's keep it as it is.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present the results for Gaussian kernels with two different bandwidths.
 For a larger bandwidth results are more similar to the uniform derounding
 approach: excessive coverage in the first scenario but under-performance
 and an attenuation bias in the 2nd and 3rd scenario.
 The smaller bandwidth reduces the attenuation bias and achieves in all
 three scenarios a slightly better RMSE than our omission approach.
 Yet, the confidence intervals have coverage below 95%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Derounding by simulating rounding (DSR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our final approach to derounding is computationally most expensive.
 It constructs the simulation of derounded z-statistics for any target observati
on 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 by explicitly modeling and simulating the scaling and rounding process
 that could have led to the reported 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We base the rounding simulations on the subset of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 whose standard error is reported with at least 3 significant digits.
 A simplified version of this approach corresponds of the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each observation 
\begin_inset Formula $j\in S$
\end_inset

 we first rescale its standard error 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}$
\end_inset

 to the scale of the target observation.
 More precisely, we set it to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}_{ji}=\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then rescale the estimated coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{j}$
\end_inset

 such that the z-statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

 remains unchanged, i.e.
 we set 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}_{ji}=z_{j}\tilde{\sigma}_{ji}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We then round 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\sigma}_{ji}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mu}_{ji}$
\end_inset

 to the same number of decimal places as observation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ij}$
\end_inset

 be the reported z-statistic given this rounded value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We collect the original z-statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

 from all observations where the rounded statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the reported z-statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 of our target observation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We repeat steps 1-4 several times until we have collected at least 10,000
 z-statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

 for target 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 We also repeat the procedure for each target 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 whose z-statistic we want to deround.
 Afterwards we proceed as in our earlier derounding approaches but pick
 the derounding draw for each target observation 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 from the more than 10,000 collected z-statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get a smoother distribution of the derounded z-statistic for each target
 observation 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

, our actual procedure modifies the simplified procedure above as follows.
 Instead of using the actual observations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}$
\end_inset

, we draw each time uniformly derounded values 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mu}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 E.g.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}=0.05$
\end_inset

 we draw 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{i}$
\end_inset

 from a uniform distribution on the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $[0.045;0.055]$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j},$
\end_inset

 we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}_{j}=\hat{\mu}_{j}/\hat{\sigma}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will apply the derounding by simulating rounding (DSR) procedure on BCH's
 data set but do not perform a Monte-Carlo simulation of the approach, since
 it is too time consuming.
 Similar to the z-density adjusted derounding, we apply DSR derounding only
 for target observations whose standard error is reported with less than
 3 significant digits and perform uniform derounding for the remaining observati
ons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Reanalyzing BCH's randomization and caliper tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we replicate BCH's randomization and caliper tests at the
 5% significane threshold using the different approaches to adjust for (coarse)
 rounding.
 BCH compare the evidence for p-hacking between four different identification
 strategies: difference-in-difference (DID), instrumental variable (IV),
 randomized experiment (RCT) and regression discontinuity design (RDD).
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:sample_by_method"

\end_inset

 shows that the share of observations with a z-statistic of exactly 2 differs
 substantially between the subsamples corresponding to the different identificat
ion strategies.
 In the smallest window studied by BCH, it ranges from only 16.6% for IV
 to 50.0% for DID.
 Correspondingly, adjusting for rounding errors affects in particular the
 DID results.

 than tests from RCT studies of which 46.9% are significant in that window.
 Overall, the estimates for IV are very similar to those of BCH and remain
 significant when performing our adjustment for rounding errors.
 In contrast, effect sizes for DID substantially reduce with our adjustment
 and, contrasting the findings of BCH, are not significant in any specification.
 So after adjustment for rounding errors, the caliper tests provide no more
 evidence for p-hacking of DID studies at the 5% threshold than the randomizatio
n tests.

 Compared to no adjustment, the main effect of the adjustment procedures
 is to remove the bunching at particular z-statistics; most importantly
 the bunching at

\end_inset

 just right of the 5% significance threshold that caused the substantial
 imbalance in the randomization tests and the caliper tests.
 The general shape of the kernel density estimate with two humps looks relativel
y similar across all approaches, including the no adjustment case.
 Intuitively, kernel density estimates themselves smooth out the bunching
 points and thus have some analogous effects to derounding.
 Appendix A2 shows similar results also in the subsamples separated by identific
ation strategy.

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the default kernel density estimator (dark gray line on left)
 used by BCH is biased towards zero at the left margin.
 We use a corrected density estimator (black line) that is based on the
 assumption that original z-statistics where distributed symmetrically around
 0.
 We see that the corrected kernel density is much more in line with the
 histograms close to the 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0$

 While BCH labelled the form of original kernel density estimator as camel
 shaped this label fits less obviously with the corrected density estimator
 where the first hump peaks at zero.

Excess Test Statistics

 the distribution of z-statistics would follow for each causal identification
 strategy a non-central t-distribution truncated at

 They calibrate, separately for each subsample, the degrees of freedom and
 non-centrality parameters of those t-distributions by matching only the

\end_inset

 Whether we adjust for rounding (black line) or take the unadjusted z-statistics
 (gray line) leads visually only to small differences.
 BCH suggest that the differences between the empirical densities and the
 t-distribution indicate distortions arising from publication bias or p-hacking.
 They derive quantitative distortion measures by comparing the probability
 masses in certain intervals such as 
\begin_inset Formula $[1.96,2.58]$
\end_inset

.
 Given that the unsmoothed empirical distributions are used for those measures,
 adjustment for rounding errors may have a somewhat stronger effect than
 Figure

 suggests.
 We do not argue though that rounding errors importantly change the qualitative
 insights from these exercises.
 Yet, we see other problems.

We assume that the observed test statistic distribution above z = 5 should
 be free of p-hacking or publication bias—the incentives to p-hack in a

 zero.

However, even if publication bias only reduces the publication probability
 for small absolute z-statistics, it will also affect the observed density

 We consider a model in which the latent distribution of z-statistics absent

 The observed distribution of z-statistics is subject to a publication bias
 such that observations with 
\begin_inset Formula $abs(z)\leq1.9$
\end_inset

 only have a 50% probability to be published.
 The left panel shows the densities of the latent and observed distribution
 and the right panel the density ratios.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 illustrates this point with a simple simulated data set.
 The latent distribution of z-statistics absent publication bias follows
 a t-distribution with one degree of freedom.
 The observed distribution of z-statistics is subject to a publication bias
 such that observations with 
\begin_inset Formula $abs(z)\leq1.9$
\end_inset

 only have a 50% probability to be published.
 For absolute z-statistics below 1.9, this publication bias leads to a lower
 density in the observed z-statistics compared to the latent distribution.
 Yet, on the other hand, for absolute z-statistics above 1.9, it also yields
 a more than 50% higher density for the observed z-statistics compared to
 the latent distribution.
 Hence, fitting a non-central t-distribution by matching the tails of the
 observed distribution for 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq5$
\end_inset

 would not recover the original distribution of z-statistics.
 More generally, we can establish
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{*}(z)$
\end_inset

 be a distribution function of the absolute z-statistics absent publication
 bias.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p(z)\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 be the publication probability of a test with z-statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z)$
\end_inset

 denote the resulting distribution function of observed z-statistics.
 We assume publication bias is present, i.e.
 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq0$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z)<F^{*}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Assume there is a threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{z}>0$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(z)=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq\bar{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Then for every 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq\bar{z}$
\end_inset

 we find
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-F(z)=\mu\left(1-F^{*}(z)\right)
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu>1$
\end_inset

.
 This means that the tails of the distribution of observed z-statistics
 starting at a z-statistic above which no publication bias takes place have
 a higher probability mass than the corresponding tails in the latent distributi
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{F}(z)=\int_{0}^{z}p(z)dF^{*}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $M=\lim_{z\rightarrow\infty}\tilde{F}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is strictly below 1.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=1/M$
\end_inset

.
 The distribution function of observed z statistics is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z)=\mu\tilde{F}(z)$
\end_inset

.
 For any pair 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1}\geq\bar{z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{2}\geq z_{1}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{*}(z_{2})-F^{*}(z_{1})=\tilde{F}(z_{2})-\tilde{F}(z_{1})$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $p(z)=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq\bar{z}.$
\end_inset

 This implies 
\begin_inset Formula $F(z_{2})-F(z_{1})=\mu(F^{*}(z_{2})-F^{*}(z_{1})).$
\end_inset

 The proposition follows from setting 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{1}=z$
\end_inset

 and taking the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{2}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Assumed benchmark distributions have smaller probability mass for small
 z-statistics than observed distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compared to the empirical distribution of z-statistics, the latent distributions
 proposed by BCH have much smaller densities for z-statistics close to 0.
 There seems no plausible explanation why p-hacking or publication bias
 should increase the density of z-statistics close to zero, we would rather
 expect the opposite.
 This observation was not evident in BCH since they used as biased kernel
 density estimator that wrongfully suggested also low empirical density
 of z-statistics close to zero.

Approach of Andrews and Kasy (2019)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Andrews and Kasy (2019) explore two approaches to estimate the relative
 publication probabilities conditional on a z-statistic and the benchmark
 distribution of z-statistics absent publication bias.
 The first approach relies on an appropriate subset of studies for which
 p-hacking or publication bias is unlikely, e.g.
 studies from systematic replication projects.
 The second approach crucially relies on the identifying assumption that
 in the unobserved latent distribution absent publication bias, the standard
 error 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 and estimated coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 are independently distributed from each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BCH adopt this second approach in section 3D assuming the benchmark distribution
 for absolute z-statistics is a generalized t-distribution.
 First, note that many of our earlier remarks concerning the assumption
 of such a uni-modal distribution for absolute z-statistics still apply.
 Yet, perhaps more importantly, we do not believe that it is valid to use
 this approach by Andrews and Kasy (2019) for the given data set, because
 the independence assumption between 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 seems strongly violated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a statistical test, we compute for all observations the weighted correlation
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\log abs(\mu_{i})$
\end_inset

 using as weights the inverse of the estimated publication probabilities.
 Under the null hypothesis that all assumptions of the chosen implementation
 of the Andrews and Kasy (2019) approach are satisfied, this inverse probability
 weighting allows to recover the correlation in the unobserved latent distributi
on of tests if no publication bias was present.

\begin_layout Standard
The correlations range from 0.89 to 0.92 and the 95% confidence intervals
 from 0.88 to 0.93.
 These results suggest that the crucial independence assumption of Andrews
 and Kasy (2019) is strongly violated in BCH's data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our intuition for that correlation is that a lot of variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 is driven by the scaling of the dependent and explanatory variables in
 the regressions.
 For example, if we rescaled all explanatory variables in a regression by
 multiplying them with a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1/m$
\end_inset

, then the corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 would both change by the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 This can lead to a strong positive correlation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\log abs(\mu_{i})$
\end_inset

 even absent publication bias.

\begin_layout Section
Concluding discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interpreting the 2nd hump
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even after adjusting for rounding, the empirical distribution of z-statistics
 robustly exhibits two humps, one at zero and one loosely around 
\begin_inset Formula $z=2$
\end_inset

.
 Is this 2nd hump already evidence for p-hacking or publication bias? Not
 necessarily.
 An alternative explanation could be that the latent distribution is a mixture
 distribution arising from differently targeted research questions.
 For example, some studies are likely to refine previous research that found
 significant effects, while other research questions are more exploratory
 without a strong prior that actual effects should be present.
 For a numerical illustration, we pick 5,000 random draws from an equal
 mixture of three Cauchy distributions all with scale parameter 0.8: one
 distribution has a location parameter of 0 and shall correspond to exploratory
 research and the other two have location parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 and shall correspond to more targeted research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:cauchy-sim"

\end_inset

 shows that the resulting distribution of absolute z-statistics is very
 similar to the empirical distribution in the pooled data (excluding observation
s with 
\begin_inset Formula $s<37$
\end_inset

).
 This simple model of differently focused research can similarly generate
 two humps, even though p-values are not hacked and the publication probability
 does not depend on the resulting z-statistic of any research project.
 Of course, the 2nd hump could also be driven to some extent or even completely
 by publication bias or p-hacking.
 In our view, it is very hard to find a convincing route to disentangle
 the sources of the hump using BCH's data set.

One may argue that allowing mixture distributions as latent distributions
 just grants too much flexibility.
 Note, however, that in their excess statistics approach BCH assume that
 the parameters of the latent t-distributions vary across empirical methods.
 This implicitly also assumes that the z-statistics for the pooled data

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, note that any latent distribution with a peak strictly above zero
 for the absolute z-statistics implies, similar to mixture distributions,
 more than one peak for the distribution of all negative and positive z-statisti
cs if we assume z-statistics are symmetrically distributed around 0.

 in the appendix show the results of the randomization tests at the 1% and
 10% significance thresholds.
 At the 10% threshold we find significantly more than 50% of tests above
 the threshold for all window sizes for IV and the pooled data, and for
 larger window sizes also for DID and selectively for RCT.
 As Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:dist-z-pooled"

\end_inset

 shows, densities of z-statistics generally slope upwards around this threshold.
 In contrast, at the 1% threshold, the densities slope downwards and the
 share of tests with 
\begin_inset Formula $z\geq2.576$
\end_inset

 is significantly below 50% for many window half-widths.
 So the interpretation of the randomization tests at these thresholds is
 not straightforward as it depends on interpretation of the hump whose slope
 affects the results.
 The randomization tests with smaller window sizes at the 5% threshold seem
 less affected by the interpretation of the hump since this threshold lies
 in all subsamples close to the peak of the 2nd hump where the assumption
 of a locally flat slope absent p-hacking and publication bias seems more
 plausible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparing densities with RCT densities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BCH also discuss the idea, albeit noting that they do not prefer it, to
 use the density for the RCT subsample as a benchmark for the densities
 of the DID, IV and RDD subsamples.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vs_rct"

\end_inset

 shows this comparison.
 We see how RCT publications have relatively more insignificant z-statistics
 than all other three methods, and the differences are particularly pronounced
 for IV and DID.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the total density must be balanced, we find a relatively higher share
 of significant tests for DID and IV studies than for RCT.
 As the log ratios of the densities in the lower panel of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vs_rct"

\end_inset

 show, the relatively higher density of significant results is not especially
 focused on the regions around the significance thresholds, where one would
 mainly expect p-hacking but peaks beyond the 1% significance threshold.
 BCH's interpretation is that this latter observation shows a weakness of
 this approach.
 Nevertheless, we find these findings very interesting, in particular, when
 considering interpretations beyond p-hacking.

 hurdles for insignificant results in RCT than in quasi-experimental studies.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A larger publication hurdle for non-RCT might be conceivable given that
 it is difficult to write pre-analysis plans and that there might be a larger
 scope for p-hacking e.g.
 in the choice of control variables.
 Requiring that also most robustness checks show significant results, could
 thus be an appropriate counter-strategy to mitigate possibly higher risks
 of wrong discoveries due to p-hacking in field studies.
 Another option to lower researchers' and reviewers' focus on arbitrary
 significance thresholds would be to ban the term statistical significance
 in papers along with banning stars in tables.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Whether or not such heterogeneous publication hurdles might be warranted,
 e.g.
 if the potential for p-hacking differs between RCT and non-RCT, is an interesti
